  - Due to the course's quality and reviews, multiple programmers recommended I enroll in this online introductory computer science course before coming to college. I started the course but didn't have enough time to finish before coming to Miami. For completion's sake, I finished the course during the winter break of January 2022. The course did a fantastic job explaining the fundamentals of problem solving, programming, and computing in general. The course touched on eleven topics that were covered a week each: problem solving, C, arrays, algorithms, memory, data structures, Python, SQL, web application programming, Flask, and ethics. Every week's lecture, except the last, had a corresponding problem set, and the course culminated with a final project.
